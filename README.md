##Javascript
##Java Script Quiz
###I created a Javascript quiz using javascript. I created a questions variable with an array of multiple choice answers assigning true or false depending on which was the correct answer, created a function to set a timer for 60 seconds to decrease at an interval of 1 second until the clock hits 0, a function that randomizes the order in which the questions are asked.
